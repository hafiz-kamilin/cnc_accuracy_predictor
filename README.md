This simulation program work based on the premises that error rate of precise metalwork created with CNC machine influenced from the surrounding temperature, the number of time the CNC was used without being calibrated (or drill wears), and how complex the manufacturing command is.

## Test run

1. Download the self-extracting package from this [link](https://github.com/hafiz-kamilin/cnc_accuracy_predictor/releases/tag/v0.1).
2. Run the package and extract it to the desired place.
3. Open the folder and run the シミュレーションプログラムを実行する.bat program.

## Note

This program interface was written in Japanese for my internship at Miyahara Co Ltd, from 17 March 2021 to 19 March 2021.
